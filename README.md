In this project, I've embarked on the journey of creating a collection of recipes.

Through this project, I've demonstrated proficiency in understanding HTML elements and tags, crafting HTML boilerplate for web development, formatting text effectively, managing lists, incorporating hyperlinks and images, utilizing Git for version control, and navigating the command-line interface.
